    \chapter{Introduction}

    Welcome to your thesis template! To begin with, a brief explanation on how to use the template. The main \TeX\, file is \texttt{thesis\_msc.tex} and it is the one that you should be able to compile always. The rest of the files are gathered in subdirectories, and you can compile them independently (with exception of the references). This independent compilation is a good tool, since you'll be adding a ton of text it is a pain to always wait for the \texttt{thesis\_msc.tex} file to finish compiling. By adding small files to compile you have a better and cleaner view of your thesis chapters.
