The folowing TeX files contains all necessary packages and LaTeX structure for the Uni-Bonn master thesis. The main motivation for this project was the lack of resources and the messy structure for the current Uni-Bonn template. Please notice that the following document **is not** an official template for the Uni-Bonn master thesis.

The thesis is divided into:

* Title page
* Dedication (optional)
* Declaration
* Abstract
* Acknowledgements (optional)
* ToC, LoF, LoT
* Chapters
* Appendices
* Bibliography

In Chapter 1 I have written several examples on basic functions, not common for TeX users. If this is your first time using LaTeX, stop reading this and start looking at some introduction, e.g. [the not so short introduction to LaTeX](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/?lang=en) (worthwhile giving it a look even though you're an experienced user!).


## Recommended LaTeX editor

Once you have installed LaTeX, I strongly encourage you to use Sublime, the editor is great and it works ridiculously good along TeX files. See [LateXTools: A LaTeX Plugin for Sublime Text 2 and 3](https://latextools.readthedocs.io).

## To-Do's
I don't want to make a (LaTeX) package out of this template, I only want to point out what are the useful enviroments and a way to structure text that you'd like. In this sense I'll add some examples, check this webste once in a while and I'll have new stuff and ideas to improve your thesis!

- [x] Table example
- [ ] Big table example
- [x] Tikz example
- [x] Image example
- [x] Python scaling figures
- [ ] Minipage and placing the caption on the side

* By far the best LaTeX forum [TeX](https://tex.stackexchange.com).
* When you know the symbol but you don't know how is it called, then draw it with [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/).
* Tikz examples, [TeXample](http://www.texample.net/).
