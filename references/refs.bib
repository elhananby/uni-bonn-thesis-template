	abstract = {Animal behavior is principally expressed through neural control of muscles. Therefore understanding how the brain controls behavior requires mapping neuronal circuits all the way to motor neurons. We have previously established technology to collect large-volume electron microscopy data sets of neural tissue and fully reconstruct the morphology of the neurons and their chemical synaptic connections throughout the volume. Using these tools we generated a dense wiring diagram, or connectome, for a large portion of the Drosophila central brain. However, in most animals, including the fly, the majority of motor neurons are located outside the brain in a neural center closer to the body, i.e. the mammalian spinal cord or insect ventral nerve cord ({VNC}). In this paper, we extend our effort to map full neural circuits for behavior by generating a connectome of the {VNC} of a male fly.},

We find that the fly {VNC} contains roughly 45 million synapses and 14,600 neuronal cell bodies.

	abstract = {In dipterous insects, a volume of behavioral and electrophysiological studies promote the contention that three wide-field motion-sensitive tangential neurons provide a necessary and sufficient input to specific channels that drive the torque motor during flight. The present studies describe the results of neuroanatomical investigations of the relationships between motion-sensitive neuropil in the fly optic lobes and descending neurons that arise from a restricted area of the brain and supply segmental neck and flight motor neuropil. The present observations resolve at least 50 pairs of descending neurons supplying flight motor centers in the thoracic ganglia. The majority of descending neurons receive a distributed output from horizontal motion-sensitive neurons. However, the same descending neurons are also visited by numerous small-field retinotopic neurons from the lobula plate as well as hitherto undescribed small tangential neurons. Neuroanatomical studies, using cobalt, Golgi, and Texas red histology, demonstrate that these smaller inputs onto descending neurons have dendrites that are organized at specific strata in retinotopic neuropil and that these correspond to horizontal and vertical motion sensitivity layers. Conclusions that only a restricted number of wide-field neurons are necessary and sufficient for visually stabilized flight may be premature. Rather, neuroanatomical evidence suggests that descending neurons to the flight motor may each be selectively tuned to specific combinations of wide- and small-field visual cues, so providing a cooperative descending network controlling the rich repertoire of visually evoked flight behavior.},

	abstract = {1.Two rules are proposed which can account for the way image motion in a horizontal plane {helpsSyritta} pipiens cope with disturbances during voluntary flight. The fly seems to assume that it moves within a stationary environment and that externally generated image motion is the result of some disturbance to its intended flight pattern and should be minimized.2.The first rule is concerned with the control of angular velocity. {WhenSyritta} cruises with no clear goal in view it keeps the angular orientation of its body constant apart from saccade-like reorientations. Thus during undisturbed flight there will be image motion all over the retina, except for regions which either look along the direction of flight or directly behind.Syritta can thus assume that any image motion over these regions (the poles of the flow field) is caused by a disturbance. Duringforward flight externally generated image motion only influences the fly's angular velocity if it occurs overfrontal retina (Fig. 6). But when the fly movessideways with respect to its long axis, so that the pole of the flow field shifts to lateral retina, image motion confined to frontal retina no longer has any effect on angular velocity (Fig. 6). It is therefore proposed that during cruising angular orientation is governed principally by image motion over the poles of the flow field.3.The second rule covers the control of translational velocity. This parameter seems to be governed by externally generated image motion over a much wider area of retina. It is proposed that each small region of retina influences a component of thrust at right angles to the direction of regard of that retinal region. The total translational response is assumed to be caused by the summed effects of image motion over many such retinal areas. Support for this rule comes from the behaviour {ofSyritta} when flying parallel to a vertically striped wall that moves from side to side (Fig. 7). The movement of the wall influences a component of thrust parallel to the wall, whether the fly views the wall with frontal or with lateral retina.4.It is explained how these two rules can resolve the image motion resulting from a disturbance like a gust of wind into rotational and translational components.},

Flies display an elaborate repertoire of visually controlled flight maneuvres of which very little has been detected as yet with Drosophila and Musca in stationary flight. Since in free flight studies data are obtained through frame by frame analysis of motion pictures, normally only short episodes are recorded, showing the dependence of the flight trajectory upon certain visual stimuli such as, for instance, another fly, a stationary object among other objects, or a large rotating drum with vertical stripes surrounding the fly.},

	abstract = {One of the last enquiries inspired by Theodosius Dobzhansky is entitled, “How far do flies fly?”.1 The paper refers to several field studies where a labelled strain of Drosophila was released and its dispersal measured by recapture of labelled flies on subsequent days. If the dispersal is simply due to random movements of the flies, then it should be analogous to the dispersal of small particles performing Brownian movements. Expected, in this case, is a normal distribution of the flies such that the increase of their mean distance from the release point is proportional to the square root of the time elapsed since the release. The expected time dependence of the dispersal seems to hold, more or less, for colonies of D. pseudoobscura, and the diffusion model may be considered as a reasonable first approximation of the locomotor behavior. However, the expected profile of the distribution has not been verified. Conspicuously more flies were recaptured both near the release point and at the outer periphery of the field. This discrepancy was explained by the tendency of Drosophila either to remain in a favorable habitat, or to cover great distances in search of such a habitat. The observation suggests that the control of locomotion can be adapted by the fly to different situations and requirements. The locomotor behavior of D. melanogaster has been extensively studied in laboratory experiments. Most of the results obtained so far refer to optomotor responses which enable the fly to maintain a given course and altitude over extended periods of time.},

We recorded changes in stroke kinematics in response to mechanical and visual rotations delivered within a flight simulator. Our results show that the visual system is tuned to relatively slow rotation whereas the haltere-mediated response to mechanical rotation increases with rising angular velocity. The integration of feedback from these two modalities may enhance aerodynamic performance by enabling the fly to sense a wide range of angular velocities during flight.},

            For any organism tracking a chemical cue to its source, the motion of its surrounding fluid provides crucial information for success. For both swimming and flying animals engaged in olfactory search, turning into the direction of oncoming wind or water current is often a critical first step [Marsh et al., 1978, Carton and Montgomery, 2003]. However, in nature, wind and water currents may not always provide a reliable directional cue [Crall et al., 2017, Houle and van Breugel, 2023, Carvalho and Gonçalves, 2020], and it is unclear how organisms adjust their search strategies accordingly due to the challenges of separately controlling flow and chemical encounters. Here, we use the genetic toolkit of
            Drosophila melanogaster
            , a model organism for olfaction [Benton, 2022], to develop an optogenetic paradigm to deliver temporally precise “virtual” olfactory experiences in free-flying animals while independently manipulating the wind conditions. We show that in free flight,
            Drosophila melanogaster
            adopt distinct search routines that are gated by whether they are flying in laminar wind or in still air. We first confirm that in laminar wind flies turn upwind, and further, we show that they achieve this using a rapid turn. In still air, flies adopt remarkably stereotyped “sink and circle” search state characterized by ∼60°turns at 3-4 Hz, biased in a consistent direction. In both laminar wind and still air, immediately after odor onset, flies decelerate and often perform a rapid turn. Both maneuvers are consistent with predictions from recent control theoretic analyses for how insects may estimate properties of wind while in flight [van Breugel, 2021, van Breugel et al., 2022]. We suggest that flies may use their deceleration and “anemometric” turn as active sensing maneuvers to rapidly gauge properties of their wind environment before initiating a proximal or upwind search routine.},

Here we explore how flies move in two dimensions (2D) using a visual {VR} environment that more closely captures an animal’s experience during free behavior. We show that flies’ 2D interaction with landmarks cannot be automatically derived from their orienting behavior under simpler one-dimensional (1D) conditions. Using novel paradigms, we then demonstrate that flies in 2D {VR} adapt their behavior in response to optogenetically delivered appetitive and aversive stimuli. Much like free-walking flies after encounters with food, head-fixed flies exploring a 2D {VR} respond to optogenetic activation of sugar-sensing neurons by initiating a local search, which appears not to rely on visual landmarks. Visual landmarks can, however, help flies to avoid areas in {VR} where they experience an aversive, optogenetically generated heat stimulus. By coupling aversive virtual heat to the flies’ presence near visual landmarks of specific shapes, we elicit selective learned avoidance of those landmarks. Thus, we demonstrate that head-fixed flies adaptively navigate in 2D virtual environments, but their reliance on visual landmarks is context dependent. These behavioral paradigms set the stage for interrogation of the fly brain circuitry underlying flexible navigation in complex multisensory environments.},

The function and biophysical mechanisms of most such modulations remain unresolved. Here, we combine behavioral genetics, electrophysiology, and high-speed videography to advance a function for behavioral modulations of visual processing in Drosophila. We argue that a set of motion-sensitive visual neurons regulate gaze-stabilizing head movements. We describe how, during flight turns, Drosophila perform a set of head movements that require silencing their gaze-stability reflexes along the primary rotation axis of the turn. Consistent with this behavioral requirement, we find pervasive motor-related inputs to the visual neurons, which quantitatively silence their predicted visual responses to rotations around the relevant axis while preserving sensitivity around other axes. This work proposes a function for a behavioral modulation of visual processing and illustrates how the brain can remove one sensory signal from a circuit carrying multiple related signals.},

	abstract = {The means by which brains transform sensory information into coherent motor actions is poorly understood. In flies, a relatively small set of descending interneurons are responsible for conveying sensory information and higher-order commands from the brain to motor circuits in the ventral nerve cord. Here, we describe three pairs of genetically identified descending interneurons that integrate information from wide-field visual interneurons and project directly to motor centers controlling flight behavior. We measured the physiological responses of these three cells during flight and found that they respond maximally to visual movement corresponding to rotation around three distinct body axes. After characterizing the tuning properties of an array of nine putative upstream visual interneurons, we show that simple linear combinations of their outputs can predict the responses of the three descending cells. Last, we developed a machine vision-tracking system that allows us to monitor multiple motor systems simultaneously and found that each visual descending interneuron class is correlated with a discrete set of motor programs.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} Most animals possess specialized sensory systems for encoding body rotation, which they use for stabilizing posture and regulating motor actions. In flies and other insects, the visual system contains an array of specialized neurons that integrate local optic flow to estimate body rotation during locomotion. However, the manner in which the output of these cells is transformed by the downstream neurons that innervate motor centers is poorly understood. We have identified a set of three visual descending neurons that integrate the output of nine large-field visual interneurons and project directly to flight motor centers. Our results provide new insight into how the sensory information that encodes body motion is transformed into a code that is appropriate for motor actions.},

	abstract = {Sensory feedback is a ubiquitous feature of guidance systems in both animals and engineered vehicles. For example, a common strategy for moving along a straight path is to turn such that the measured rate of rotation is zero. This task can be accomplished by using a feedback signal that is proportional to the instantaneous value of the measured sensory signal. In such a system, the addition of an integral term depending on past values of the sensory input is needed to eliminate steady-state error [proportional-integral ({PI}) control]. However, the means by which nervous systems implement such a computation are poorly understood. Here, we show that the optomotor responses of flying Drosophila follow a time course consistent with temporal integration of horizontal motion input. To investigate the cellular basis of this effect, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from the set of identified visual interneurons [horizontal system ({HS}) cells] thought to control this reflex during tethered flight. At high stimulus speeds, {HS} cells exhibit steady-state responses during flight that are absent during quiescence, a state-dependent difference in physiology that is explained by changes in their presynaptic inputs. However, even during flight, the membrane potential of the large-field interneurons exhibits no evidence for integration that could explain the behavioral responses. However, using a genetically encoded indicator, we found that calcium accumulates in the terminals of the interneurons along a time course consistent with the behavior and propose that this accumulation provides a mechanism for temporal integration of sensory feedback consistent with {PI} control.},

Here, we identify two neuronal types, P9 and {BPN}, in the \textit{Drosophila} brain that, upon activation, initiate and maintain two distinct coordinated walking patterns. P9 drives forward walking with ipsilateral turning, receives inputs from central courtship-promoting neurons and visual projection neurons, and is necessary for a male to pursue a female during courtship. In contrast, {BPN} drives straight, forward walking and is not required during courtship. {BPN} is instead recruited during and required for fast, straight, forward walking bouts.

Columnar neurons in the fan-shaped body ({FB}) of the {CX} exhibit circular dynamics that multiplex information about turning behavior and heading. These dynamics are coordinated with those in the ellipsoid body, another {CX} subregion containing a heading representation, although only {FB} neurons flip turn preference depending on the visual environment. Thus, the navigational system spans multiple subregions of the {CX}, where specific cell types show coordinated but distinct context-dependent dynamics.},

	abstract = {Landing behavior is one of the most critical, yet least studied, aspects of insect flight. In order to land safely, an insect must recognize a visual feature, navigate towards it, decelerate, and extend its legs in preparation for touchdown. Although previous studies have focused on the visual stimuli that trigger these different components, the complete sequence has not been systematically studied in a free-flying animal. Using a real-time 3D tracking system in conjunction with high speed digital imaging, we were able to capture the landing sequences of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) from the moment they first steered toward a visual target, to the point of touchdown. This analysis was made possible by a custom-built feedback system that actively maintained the fly in the focus of the high speed camera. The results suggest that landing is composed of three distinct behavioral modules. First, a fly actively turns towards a stationary target via a directed body saccade. Next, it begins to decelerate at a point determined by both the size of the visual target and its rate of expansion on the retina. Finally, the fly extends its legs when the visual target reaches a threshold retinal size of approximately 60 deg. Our data also let us compare landing sequences with flight trajectories that, although initially directed toward a visual target, did not result in landing. In these ‘fly-by’ trajectories, flies steer toward the target but then exhibit a targeted aversive saccade when the target subtends a retinal size of approximately 33 deg. Collectively, the results provide insight into the organization of sensorimotor modules that underlie the landing and search behaviors of insects.},

How central circuits flexibly process visual cues to activate appropriate, fast motor pathways remains unclear. Here we identify two descending neuron ({DN}) types that control landing and contribute to visuomotor flexibility in Drosophila. For each, silencing impairs visually evoked landing, activation drives landing, and spike rate determines leg extension amplitude. Critically, visual responses of both {DNs} are severely attenuated during non-flight periods, effectively decoupling visual stimuli from the landing motor pathway when landing is inappropriate. The flight-dependence mechanism differs between {DN} types. Octopamine exposure mimics flight effects in one, whereas the other probably receives neuronal feedback from flight motor circuits. Thus, this sensorimotor flexibility arises from distinct mechanisms for gating action-specific descending pathways, such that sensory and motor networks are coupled or decoupled according to the behavioral state.},

We performed patch-clamp recordings from motion-sensitive visual neurons in tethered, flying Drosophila. We observed motor-related signals in flies performing flight turns in rapid response to looming discs and also during spontaneous turns, but motor-related signals were weak or non-existent in the context of turns made in response to brief pulses of unidirectional visual motion (i.e., optomotor responses). Thus, the act of a locomotor turn is variably associated with modulation of visual processing. These results can be understood via the following principle: suppress visual responses during course-changing, but not course-stabilizing, navigational turns. This principle is likely to apply broadly—even to mammals—whenever visual cells whose activity helps to stabilize a locomotor trajectory or the visual gaze angle are targeted for motor modulation.},

Avoidance of a laterally positioned focus of expansion emerges from an inversion of the optomotor response when motion is restricted to the rear visual hemisphere. Furthermore, motion restricted to rear quarter-fields elicits turning responses that are independent of the direction of image motion about the animal's yaw axis.

	abstract = {Flies and other insects use vision to regulate their groundspeed in flight, enabling them to fly in varying wind conditions. Compared with mechanosensory modalities, however, vision requires a long processing delay ({\textasciitilde}100 ms) that might introduce instability if operated at high gain. Flies also sense air motion with their antennae, but how this is used in flight control is unknown. We manipulated the antennal function of fruit flies by ablating their aristae, forcing them to rely on vision alone to regulate groundspeed. Arista-ablated flies in flight exhibited significantly greater groundspeed variability than intact flies. We then subjected them to a series of controlled impulsive wind gusts delivered by an air piston and experimentally manipulated antennae and visual feedback. The results show that an antenna-mediated response alters wing motion to cause flies to accelerate in the same direction as the gust. This response opposes flying into a headwind, but flies regularly fly upwind. To resolve this discrepancy, we obtained a dynamic model of the fly’s velocity regulator by fitting parameters of candidate models to our experimental data. The model suggests that the groundspeed variability of arista-ablated flies is the result of unstable feedback oscillations caused by the delay and high gain of visual feedback. The antenna response drives active damping with a shorter delay ({\textasciitilde}20 ms) to stabilize this regulator, in exchange for increasing the effect of rapid wind disturbances. This provides insight into flies’ multimodal sensory feedback architecture and constitutes a previously unknown role for the antennae.},

For this reason, presenting a controlled visual environment to tethered insects has been and continues to be a powerful tool for studying the sensory control of complex behaviors. To create an easily controlled, scalable, and customizable visual stimulus, we have designed a modular system, based on panels composed of an 8×8 array of individual {LEDs}, that may be connected together to ‘tile’ an experimental environment with controllable displays. The panels have been designed to be extremely bright, with the added flexibility of individual-pixel brightness control, allowing experimentation over a broad range of behaviorally relevant conditions. Patterns to be displayed may be designed using custom software, downloaded to a controller board, and displayed on the individually addressed panels via a rapid communication interface. The panels are controlled by a microprocessor-based display controller which, for most experiments, will not require a computer in the loop, greatly reducing the experimental infrastructure. This technology allows an experimenter to build and program a visual arena with a customized geometry in a matter of hours. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we present results from experiments with tethered Drosophila melanogaster: (1) in a cylindrical arena composed of 44 panels, used to test the contrast dependence of object orientation behavior, and (2) above a 30-panel floor display, used to examine the effects of ground motion on orientation during flight.},

	abstract = {When confronted with a large-field stimulus rotating around the vertical body axis, flies display a following behavior called “optomotor response.” As neural control elements, the large tangential horizontal system ({HS}) cells of the lobula plate have been prime candidates for long. Here, we applied optogenetic stimulation of {HS} cells to evaluate their behavioral role in Drosophila. To minimize interference of the optical activation of channelrhodopsin-2 with the visual perception of the flies, we used a bistable variant called {ChR}2-C128S. By applying pulses of blue and yellow light, we first demonstrate electrophysiologically that lobula plate tangential cells can be activated and deactivated repeatedly with no evident change in depolarization strength over trials. We next show that selective optogenetic activation of {HS} cells elicits robust yaw head movements and yaw turning responses in fixed and tethered flying flies, respectively.},

	abstract = {Visual object tracking in animals as diverse as felines, frogs, and fish supports behaviors including predation, predator avoidance, and landscape navigation. Decades of experimental results show that a rigidly body-fixed tethered fly in a “virtual reality” visual flight simulator steers to follow the motion of a vertical bar, thereby “fixating” it on visual midline. This behavior likely reflects a desire to seek natural features such as plant stalks and has inspired algorithms for visual object tracking predicated on robust responses to bar velocity, particularly near visual midline. Using a modified flight simulator equipped with a magnetic pivot to allow frictionless turns about the yaw axis, we discovered that bar fixation as well as smooth steering responses to bar velocity are attenuated or eliminated in yaw-free conditions. Body-fixed Drosophila melanogaster respond to bar oscillation on a stationary ground with frequency-matched wing kinematics and fixate the bar on midline. Yaw-free flies respond to the same stimulus by ignoring the bar and maintaining their original heading. These differences are driven by proprioceptive signals, rather than visual signals, as artificially “clamping” a bar in the periphery of a yaw-free fly has no effect. When presented with a bar and ground oscillating at different frequencies, a yaw-free fly follows the frequency of the ground only, whereas a body-fixed fly robustly steers at the frequencies of both the bar and ground. Our findings support a model in which proprioceptive feedback promote active damping of high-gain optomotor responses to object motion.},

Using a specialized flight simulator we presented tethered flies with simultaneous visual and mechanosensory oscillations while measuring compensatory changes in stroke kinematics. By varying the relative amplitude,phase and axis of rotation of the visual and mechanical stimuli, we were able to determine the contribution of each sensory modality to the compensatory motor reflex. Our results show that over a wide range of experimental conditions sensory inputs from halteres and the visual system are combined in a weighted sum. Furthermore, the weighting structure places greater influence on feedback from the halteres than from the visual system.},

This problem is particularly demanding for insects such as Drosophila, which must adjust wing motion for both quick voluntary maneuvers and slow compensatory reflexes using only a dozen pairs of muscles. To identify strategies by which animals execute precise actions using sparse motor networks, we imaged the activity of a complete ensemble of wing control muscles in intact, flying flies. Our experiments uncovered a remarkably efficient logic in which each of the four skeletal elements at the base of the wing are equipped with both large phasically active muscles capable of executing large changes and smaller tonically active muscles specialized for continuous fine-scaled adjustments. Based on the responses to a broad panel of visual motion stimuli, we have developed a model by which the motor array regulates aerodynamically functional features of wing motion.

	abstract = {Flies rely heavily on visual feedback for several aspects of flight control. As a fly approaches an object, the image projected across its retina expands, providing the fly with visual feedback that can be used either to trigger a collision-avoidance maneuver or a landing response. To determine how a fly makes the decision to land on or avoid a looming object, we measured the behaviors generated in response to an expanding image during tethered flight in a visual closed-loop flight arena. During these experiments, each fly varied its wing-stroke kinematics to actively control the azimuth position of a 15°×15° square within its visual field. Periodically, the square symmetrically expanded in both the horizontal and vertical directions. We measured changes in the fly's wing-stroke amplitude and frequency in response to the expanding square while optically tracking the position of its legs to monitor stereotyped landing responses. Although this stimulus could elicit both the landing responses and collision-avoidance reactions, separate pathways appear to mediate the two behaviors. For example, if the square is in the lateral portion of the fly's field of view at the onset of expansion, the fly increases stroke amplitude in one wing while decreasing amplitude in the other, indicative of a collision-avoidance maneuver. In contrast, frontal expansion elicits an increase in wing-beat frequency and leg extension,indicative of a landing response. To further characterize the sensitivity of these responses to expansion rate, we tested a range of expansion velocities from 100 to 10 000° s-1. Differences in the latency of both the collision-avoidance reactions and the landing responses with expansion rate supported the hypothesis that the two behaviors are mediated by separate pathways. To examine the effects of visual feedback on the magnitude and time course of the two behaviors, we presented the stimulus under open-loop conditions, such that the fly's response did not alter the position of the expanding square. From our results we suggest a model that takes into account the spatial sensitivities and temporal latencies of the collision-avoidance and landing responses, and is sufficient to schematically represent how the fly uses integration of motion information in deciding whether to turn or land when confronted with an expanding object.},

	abstract = {Automated tracking of animal movement allows analyses that would not otherwise be possible by providing great quantities of data. The additional capability of tracking in real time—with minimal latency—opens up the experimental possibility of manipulating sensory feedback, thus allowing detailed explorations of the neural basis for control of behaviour. Here, we describe a system capable of tracking the three-dimensional position and body orientation of animals such as flies and birds. The system operates with less than 40 ms latency and can track multiple animals simultaneously. To achieve these results, a multi-target tracking algorithm was developed based on the extended Kalman filter and the nearest neighbour standard filter data association algorithm. In one implementation, an 11-camera system is capable of tracking three flies simultaneously at 60 frames per second using a gigabit network of nine standard Intel Pentium 4 and Core 2 Duo computers. This manuscript presents the rationale and details of the algorithms employed and shows three implementations of the system. An experiment was performed using the tracking system to measure the effect of visual contrast on the flight speed of
              Drosophila melanogaster
              . At low contrasts, speed is more variable and faster on average than at high contrasts. Thus, the system is already a useful tool to study the neurobiology and behaviour of freely flying animals. If combined with other techniques, such as ‘virtual reality’-type computer graphics or genetic manipulation, the tracking system would offer a powerful new way to investigate the biology of flying animals.},

Flies in the flight simulator maintain a stable orientation even in a homogeneously textured panorama without landmarks. During 'straight' flight, torque is not zero. It consists of small pulses mostly alternating in polarity. The course is controlled by the duration (and possibly amplitude) of the pulses. The system operates under reafference control. By comparing the pulses with the visual input the system continuously measures and adjusts the efficacy of the torque output. The comparison, however, is not between angular velocity and yaw torque but, instead, between visual acceleration and pretorque, the first time derivative of torque. For comparison, the system first computes a cross-correlation. If the correlation coefficient is above a certain threshold the system calculates the external gain and adjusts its internal gain so as to keep the total gain constant. With the correlation coefficient below threshold, however, the system keeps the internal gain low despite the infinitely small external gain. We propose that for a reafferent optomotor system the coupling coefficient and the correlation coefficient of pretorque and visual acceleration are more relevant than the distinction between exafference and reafference.},

	abstract = {Summary It has long been known that many flying insects use visual cues to orient with respect to the wind and to control their groundspeed in the face of varying wind conditions. Much less explored has been the role of mechanosensory cues in orienting insects relative to the ambient air. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster, magnetically tethered so as to be able to rotate about their yaw axis, are able to detect and orient into a wind, as would be experienced during forward flight. Further, this behavior is velocity dependent and is likely subserved, at least in part, by the Johnston’s organs, chordotonal organs in the antennae also involved in near-field sound detection. These wind-mediated responses may help to explain how flies are able to fly forward despite visual responses that might otherwise inhibit this behavior. Expanding visual stimuli, such as are encountered during forward flight, are the most potent aversive visual cues known for D. melanogaster flying in a tethered paradigm. Accordingly, tethered flies strongly orient towards a focus of contraction, a problematic situation for any animal attempting to fly forward. We show in this study that wind stimuli, transduced via mechanosensory means, can compensate for the aversion to visual expansion and thus may help to explain how these animals are indeed able to maintain forward flight.},

	abstract = {In the present study we investigated the behavioural strategies with which freely flying fruit flies (Drosophila) control their flight trajectories during active optomotor stimulation in a free-flight arena. We measured forward, turning and climbing velocities of single flies using high-speed video analysis and estimated the output of a ‘Hassenstein–Reichardt’ elementary motion detector ({EMD}) array and the fly’s gaze to evaluate flight behaviour in response to a rotating visual panorama. In a stationary visual environment, flight is characterized by flight saccades during which the animals turn on average 120° within 130 ms. In a rotating environment, the fly’s behaviour typically changes towards distinct, concentric circular flight paths where the radius of the paths increases with increasing arena velocity. The {EMD} simulation suggests that this behaviour is driven by a rotation-sensitive {EMD} detector system that minimizes retinal slip on each compound eye, whereas an expansion-sensitive {EMD} system with a laterally centred visual focus potentially helps to achieve centring response on the circular flight path. We developed a numerical model based on force balance between horizontal, vertical and lateral forces that allows predictions of flight path curvature at a given locomotor capacity of the fly. The model suggests that turning flight in Drosophila is constrained by the production of centripetal forces needed to avoid side-slip movements. At maximum horizontal velocity this force may account for up to 70\% of the fly’s body weight during yaw turning. Altogether, our analyses are widely consistent with previous studies on Drosophila free flight and those on the optomotor response under tethered flight conditions.},

	abstract = {Tethered flight mills and free-­flight studies are two common approaches for examining insect flight behavior in the laboratory. Flight behavior studies are significant because they provide information with understanding dispersal and range expansion. Each approach has advantages and drawbacks and can influence the flight behavior of the study organism. However, tethered and untethered flight studies are rarely performed simultaneously to determine whether one technique is better suited for a particular species. Here, we conducted a tethered and untethered flight study to determine the limitations, benefits, and effects the two methods could have on assessing an insect's flight capacity. We focused the study on the global invasive pest, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae). Propensity of flight and flight duration, distance, and velocity were examined for (1) females and males, and (2) summer and winter morphs, as the two morphs differ significantly in body and wing size. The study showed that summer morphs were more likely to fly when untethered than when tethered to a flight mill. Additionally, when comparing the length of time of flight for first take-­off, D. suzukii flew longer when untethered. Outcomes from this study provide information on D. suzukii flight behavior, which could assist with future research on this economically important fruit pest that is rapidly expanding its range. The results also suggest that the flight apparatus can affect D. suzukii flight behaviors, such that future laboratory flight research should be considerate of the flight technique utilized.},

	abstract = {{SUMMARY}
            Using 3D infrared high-speed video, we captured the continuous wing and body kinematics of free-flying fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster,during hovering and slow forward flight. We then `replayed' the wing kinematics on a dynamically scaled robotic model to measure the aerodynamic forces produced by the wings. Hovering animals generate a U-shaped wing trajectory, in which large drag forces during a downward plunge at the start of each stroke create peak vertical forces. Quasi-steady mechanisms could account for nearly all of the mean measured force required to hover, although temporal discrepancies between instantaneous measured forces and model predictions indicate that unsteady mechanisms also play a significant role. We analyzed the requirements for hovering from an analysis of the time history of forces and moments in all six degrees of freedom. The wing kinematics necessary to generate sufficient lift are highly constrained by the requirement to balance thrust and pitch torque over the stroke cycle. We also compare the wing motion and aerodynamic forces of free and tethered flies. Tethering causes a strong distortion of the stroke pattern that results in a reduction of translational forces and a prominent nose-down pitch moment. The stereotyped distortion under tethered conditions is most likely due to a disruption of sensory feedback. Finally, we calculated flight power based directly on the measurements of wing motion and aerodynamic forces, which yielded a higher estimate of muscle power during free hovering flight than prior estimates based on time-averaged parameters. This discrepancy is mostly due to a two- to threefold underestimate of the mean profile drag coefficient in prior studies. We also compared our values with the predictions of the same time-averaged models using more accurate kinematic and aerodynamic input parameters based on our high-speed videography measurements. In this case, the time-averaged models tended to overestimate flight costs.},

            We have developed a computer system for reconstructing and analyzing three dimensional flight trajectories of flies. Its application to the study of the free flight behaviour of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster is described. The main results are: a) Drosophila males only occasionally track other flies; b) in such cases the fly’s angular velocity is a function of the error angle under which the leading fly is seen; c) body saccades can be demonstrated during cruising flights; d) high angular velocities are strongly correlated with low forward velocities, probably reflecting an aerodynamic constraint of flight. The 3-D technique described may provide an adequate tool for studying the organization of the systems present in flies and for relating the free flight behaviour to previous analyses of tethered flies.},

	abstract = {Summary Flying fruit ﬂies, Drosophila melanogaster, perform ‘body saccades’, in which they change heading by about 90° in roughly 70·ms. In free ﬂight, visual expansion can evoke saccades, and saccade-like turns are triggered by similar stimuli in tethered ﬂies. However, because the ﬁctive turns in rigidly tethered ﬂies follow a much longer time course, the extent to which these two behaviors share a common neural basis is unknown. A key difference between tethered and free ﬂight conditions is the presence of additional sensory cues in the latter, which might serve to modify the time course of the saccade motor program. To study the role of sensory feedback in saccades, we have developed a new preparation in which a ﬂy is tethered to a ﬁne steel pin that is aligned within a vertically oriented magnetic ﬁeld, allowing it to rotate freely around its yaw axis. In this experimental paradigm, ﬂies perform rapid turns averaging 35° in 80·ms, similar to the kinematics of free ﬂight saccades. Our results indicate that tethered and free ﬂight saccades share a common neural basis, but that the lack of appropriate feedback signals distorts the behavior performed by rigidly ﬁxed ﬂies. Using our new paradigm, we also investigated the features of visual stimuli that elicit saccades. Our data suggest that saccades are triggered when expanding objects reach a critical threshold size, but that their timing depends little on the precise time course of expansion. These results are consistent with expansion detection circuits studied in other insects, but do not exclude other models based on the integration of local movement detectors.},

In this study, we observed the body kinematics of flying Drosophila using a magnetically tethered flight assay, in which flies are free to rotate around their yaw axis, enabling naturalistic visual and proprioceptive feedback. Additionally, we used deep learning-based video analyses to characterize the kinematics of multiple body parts in flying animals. By applying this pipeline of behavioral experiments and analyses, we characterized the detailed body kinematics during rapid flight turns (or saccades) in two different visual conditions: spontaneous flight saccades under static screen and barfixating saccades while tracking a rotating bar. We found that both types of saccades involved movements of multiple body parts and that the overall dynamics were comparable. Our study highlights the importance of sensitive behavioral assays and analysis tools for characterizing complex visual behaviors.},

	abstract = {Unlike creatures that walk, ﬂying animals need to control their horizontal motion as well as their height above the ground. Research on insects, the ﬁrst animals to evolve ﬂight, has revealed several visual reﬂexes that are used to govern horizontal course. For example, insects orient toward prominent vertical features in their environment [1–5] and generate compensatory reactions to both rotations [6, 7] and translations [1, 8–11] of the visual world. Insects also avoid impending collisions by veering away from visual expansion [9, 12–14]. In contrast to this extensive understanding of the visual reﬂexes that regulate horizontal course, the sensory-motor mechanisms that animals use to control altitude are poorly understood. Using a 3D virtual reality environment, we found that Drosophila utilize three reﬂexes—edge tracking, wide-ﬁeld stabilization, and expansion avoidance—to control altitude. By implementing a dynamic visual clamp, we found that ﬂies do not regulate altitude by maintaining a ﬁxed value of optic ﬂow beneath them, as suggested by a recent model [15]. The results identify a means by which insects determine their absolute height above the ground and uncover a remarkable correspondence between the sensory-motor algorithms used to regulate motion in the horizontal and vertical domains.},

Here, we present a model-based method for the pose estimation of free-ﬂying fruit ﬂies from multi-view high-speed videos. To obtain a faithful representation of the ﬂy with minimum free parameters, our method uses a 3D model that includes two new aspects of wing deformation: a non-ﬁxed wing hinge and a twisting wing surface. The method is demonstrated for free and perturbed ﬂight. Our method does not use prior assumptions on the kinematics apart from the continuity of the wing pitch angle. Hence, this method can be readily adjusted for other insect species.},

	abstract = {In flies, mechanosensory information from modified hindwings known as halteres is combined with visual information for wing-steering behavior. Haltere input is necessary for free flight, making it difficult to study the effects of haltere ablation under natural flight conditions. We thus used tethered Drosophila melanogaster flies to examine the relationship between halteres and the visual system, using wide-field motion or moving figures as visual stimuli. Haltere input was altered by surgically decreasing its mass, or by removing it entirely. Haltere removal does not affect the flies’ ability to flap or steer their wings, but it does increase the temporal frequency at which they modify their wingbeat amplitude. Reducing the haltere mass decreases the optomotor reflex response to wide-field motion, and removing the haltere entirely does not further decrease the response. Decreasing the mass does not attenuate the response to figure motion, but removing the entire haltere does attenuate the response. When flies are allowed to control a visual stimulus in closed-loop conditions, haltereless flies fixate figures with the same acuity as intact flies, but cannot stabilize a wide-field stimulus as accurately as intact flies can. These manipulations suggest that the haltere mass is influential in wide-field stabilization, but less so in figure tracking. In both figure and wide-field experiments, we observe responses to visual motion with and without halteres, indicating that during tethered flight, intact halteres are not strictly necessary for visually guided wing-steering responses. However, the haltere feedback loop may operate in a context-dependent way to modulate responses to visual motion.},

The question of whether this behavioral variability merely reflects residual deviations due to extrinsic random noise in such otherwise deterministic systems or an intrinsic, adaptive indeterminacy trait is central for the basic understanding of brain function. Instead of random noise, we find a fractal order (resembling Lévy flights) in the temporal structure of spontaneous flight maneuvers in tethered Drosophila fruit flies. Lévy-like probabilistic behavior patterns are evolutionarily conserved, suggesting a general neural mechanism underlying spontaneous behavior. Drosophila can produce these patterns endogenously, without any external cues. The fly's behavior is controlled by brain circuits which operate as a nonlinear system with unstable dynamics far from equilibrium. These findings suggest that both general models of brain function and autonomous agents ought to include biologically relevant nonlinear, endogenous behavior-initiating mechanisms if they strive to realistically simulate biological brains or out-compete other agents.},

	abstract = {Flying fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) locate a concealed appetitive odour source most accurately in environments containing vertical visual contrasts. To investigate how visuomotor and olfactory responses may be integrated, we examine the free-flight behaviour of flies in three visual conditions, with and without food odour present. While odour localisation is facilitated by uniformly distributed vertical contrast as compared with purely horizontal contrast, localised vertical contrast also facilitates odour localisation, but only if the odour source is situated close to it. We implement a model of visuomotor control consisting of three parallel subsystems: an optomotor response stabilising the model fly's yaw orientation; a collision avoidance system to saccade away from looming obstacles; and a speed regulation system. This model reproduces many of the behaviours we observe in flies, including visually mediated ‘rebound’ turns following saccades. Using recordings of real odour plumes, we simulate the presence of an odorant in the arena, and investigate ways in which the olfactory input could modulate visuomotor control. We reproduce the experimental results by using the change in odour intensity to regulate the sensitivity of collision avoidance, resulting in visually mediated chemokinesis. Additionally, it is necessary to amplify the optomotor response whenever odour is present, increasing the model fly's tendency to steer towards features of the visual environment. We conclude that visual and olfactory responses of Drosophila are not independent, but that relatively simple interaction between these modalities can account for the observed visual dependence of odour source localisation.},

	abstract = {As an animal translates through the world, its eyes will experience a radiating pattern of optic flow in which there is a focus of expansion directly in front and a focus of contraction behind. For flying fruit flies, recent experiments indicate that flies actively steer away from patterns of expansion. Whereas such a reflex makes sense for avoiding obstacles, it presents a paradox of sorts because an insect could not navigate stably through a visual scene unless it tolerated flight towards a focus of expansion during episodes of forward translation. One possible solution to this paradox is that a fly’s behavior might change such that it steers away from strong expansion, but actively steers towards weak expansion. In this study, we use a tethered flight arena to investigate the influence of stimulus strength on the magnitude and direction of turning responses to visual expansion in flies. These experiments indicate that the expansion-avoidance behavior is speed dependent. At slower speeds of expansion, flies exhibit an attraction to the focus of expansion, whereas the behavior transforms to expansion avoidance at higher speeds. Open-loop experiments indicate that this inversion of the expansion-avoidance response depends on whether or not the head is fixed to the thorax. The inversion of the expansion-avoidance response with stimulus strength has a clear manifestation under closed-loop conditions. Flies will actively orient towards a focus of expansion at low temporal frequency but steer away from it at high temporal frequency. The change in the response with temporal frequency does not require motion stimuli directly in front or behind the fly. Animals in which the stimulus was presented within 120 deg sectors on each side consistently steered towards expansion at low temporal frequency and steered towards contraction at high temporal frequency. A simple model based on an array of Hassenstein–Reichardt type elementary movement detectors suggests that the inversion of the expansion-avoidance reflex can explain the spatial distribution of straight flight segments and collision-avoidance saccades when flies fly freely within an open circular arena.},

Central to this debate is whether wings are a novel structure on the body wall resulting from gene co-option, or evolved from an exite (outgrowth; for example, a gill) on the leg of an ancestral crustacean. Here, we report the phenotypes for the knockout of five leg patterning genes in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis and compare these with their previously published phenotypes in Drosophila and other insects. This leads to an alignment of insect and crustacean legs that suggests that two leg segments that were present in the common ancestor of insects and crustaceans were incorporated into the insect body wall, moving the proximal exite of the leg dorsally, up onto the back, to later form insect wings. Our results suggest that insect wings are not novel structures, but instead evolved from existing, ancestral structures.},

	abstract = {The evolution of avian flight can be interpreted by analyzing the sequence of modifications of the primitive tetrapod locomotor system through time. Herein, we introduce the term “locomotor module” to identify anatomical subregions of the musculoskeletal system that are highly integrated and act as functional units during locomotion. The first tetrapods, which employed lateral undulations of the entire body and appendages, had one large locomotor module. Basal dinosaurs and theropods were bipedal and possessed a smaller locomotor module consisting of the hind limb and tail. Bird flight evolved as the superimposition of a second (aerial) locomotor capability onto the ancestral (terrestrial) theropod body plan. Although the origin of the wing module was the primary innovation, alterations in the terrestrial system were also significant. We propose that the primitive theropod locomotor module was functionally and anatomically subdivided into separate pelvic and caudal locomotor modules. This decoupling freed the tail to attain a new and intimate affiliation with the forelimb during flight, a configuration unique to birds. Thus, the evolution of flight can be viewed as the origin and novel association of locomotor modules. Differential elaboration of these modules in various lineages has produced the diverse locomotor abilities of modern birds.},

The 3-dimensional velocity υxyzof the chasing fly is linearly dependent upon the distance between leading and chasing fly in males but not in females. Male chasing thus appears to be more efficient than female tracking.

The ventral nerve cords ({VNCs}) have been described from over 300 insect species covering all the major orders. Interpreting these data in the context of phylogenetic relationships reveals remarkable diversity. The presumed ancestral {VNC} structure is rarely observed; instead the {VNCs} of most insects show extensive modification and substantial convergence. Modifications include shifts in neuromere positions, their fusion to form composite ganglia, and, potentially, their separation to revert to individual ganglia. These changes appear to be facilitated by the developmental and functional modularity of the {VNC}, a neuromere for each body segment. The differences in {VNC} structure emphasize trade-offs between behavioral requirements and the costs incurred while maintaining the nervous system and signaling between its various parts. The diversity in structure also shows that nervous systems may undergo dramatic morphological changes during evolution.},

Here we review our current understanding of processing of optic flow as generated by an animal's self-motion. Optic flow processing is accomplished in a series of steps: First, the time-varying photoreceptor signals are fed into a two-dimensional array of Reichardt-type elementary motion detectors ({EMDs}). {EMDs} compute, in parallel, local motion vectors at each sampling point in space. Second, the output signals of many {EMDs} are spatially integrated on the dendrites of large-field tangential cells in the lobula plate. In the third step, tangential cells form extensive interactions with each other, giving rise to their large and complex receptive fields. Thus, tangential cells can act as matched filters tuned to optic flow during particular flight maneuvers. They finally distribute their information onto postsynaptic descending neurons, which either instruct the motor centers of the thoracic ganglion for flight and locomotion control or act themselves as motor neurons that control neck muscles for head movements.},

In the fly, Drosophila melanogaster, this is coordinated by a population of {\textasciitilde} 1100 descending neurons ({DNs}). Activating only a few {DNs} is known to be sufficient to drive complex behaviors like walking and grooming. However, what additional role the larger population of {DNs} plays during natural behaviors remains largely unknown. For example, they may modulate core behavioral commands or comprise parallel pathways that are engaged depending on sensory context. We evaluated these possibilities by recording populations of nearly 100 {DNs} in individual tethered flies while they generated limb-­dependent behaviors, including walking and grooming. We found that the largest fraction of recorded {DNs} encode walking while fewer are active during head grooming and resting. A large fraction of walk-­encoding {DNs} encode turning and far fewer weakly encode speed. Although odor context does not determine which behavior-­encoding {DNs} are recruited, a few {DNs} encode odors rather than behaviors. Lastly, we illustrate how one can identify individual neurons from {DN} population recordings by using their spatial, functional, and morphological properties. These results set the stage for a comprehensive, population-­level understanding of how the brain’s descending signals regulate complex motor actions.},

	abstract = {In most animals, a relatively small number of descending neurons ({DNs}) connect higher brain centers in the animal’s head to circuits and motor neurons ({MNs}) in the nerve cord of the animal’s body that effect movement of the limbs. To understand how brain signals generate behavior, it is critical to understand how these descending pathways are organized onto the body {MNs}. In the fly, Drosophila melanogaster, {MNs} controlling muscles in the leg, wing, and other motor systems reside in a ventral nerve cord ({VNC}), analogous to the mammalian spinal cord. In companion papers, we introduced a densely-reconstructed connectome of the Drosophila Male Adult Nerve Cord ({MANC}, Takemura et al., 2023), including cell type and developmental lineage annotation (Marin et al., 2023), which provides complete {VNC} connectivity at synaptic resolution. Here, we present a first look at the organization of the {VNC} networks connecting {DNs} to {MNs} based on this new connectome information. We proofread and curated all {DNs} and {MNs} to ensure accuracy and reliability, then systematically matched {DN} axon terminals and {MN} dendrites with light microscopy data to link their {VNC} morphology with their brain inputs or muscle targets. We report both broad organizational patterns of the entire network and fine-scale analysis of selected circuits of interest. We discover that direct {DN}-{MN} connections are infrequent and identify communities of intrinsic neurons linked to control of different motor systems, including putative ventral circuits for walking, dorsal circuits for flight steering and power generation, and intermediate circuits in the lower tectulum for coordinated action of wings and legs. Our analysis generates hypotheses for future functional experiments and, together with the {MANC} connectome, empowers others to investigate these and other circuits of the Drosophila ventral nerve cord in richer mechanistic detail.},

Special emphasis was laid on the neural circuits that detect visual features such as brightness, color, local motion, optic ﬂow, and translating or approaching visual objects, which would be important for behaviors such as phototaxis, optomotor response, attraction (or aversion) to moving objects, navigation, and visual learning. This review offers an integrative framework for how the ﬂy brain detects visual features and orchestrates an appropriate behavioral response.},

	abstract = {Experience in early life can affect the development of the nervous system. There is now evidence that experience-dependent plasticity exists in adult insects. To uncover the molecular basis of plasticity, an invertebrate model, such as \textit{Drosophila melanogaste}r, is a powerful tool, as many established genetic and molecular methods can be applied. To establish a model system in which behavioral plasticity can be examined, we investigated the optomotor response, a behavior common to most sight-reliant animals, in \textit{Drosophila} and found that the response could be modified by the level of light during rearing. The angle turned by the head in response to a moving stimulus was used to quantify the response. Deprivation of light increased the response to low-contrast stimuli in wild-type \textit{Drosophila }at 4 days after eclosion and this plastic change did not appear in \textit{rutabaga}, a known mutant defective in short-term memory. In addition, the change was transient and was markedly decreased at 6 days after eclosion. Further, we found that Dark-flies, which have been kept in constant darkness for more than 50 years, showed a higher response to low-contrast stimuli even at 6 days after eclosion compared to wild type and this characteristic was not lost in Dark-flies placed in a normal light environment for 2 generations, suggesting that this high response has a hereditary nature. Thus, our model system can be used to examine how the environment affects behaviors.},

	abstract = {Summary Fruit flies respond to panoramic retinal patterns of visual expansion with robust steering maneuvers directed away from the focus of expansion to avoid collisions and maintain an upwind flight posture. Panoramic rotation elicits comparatively weak syndirectional steering maneuvers, which also maintain visual stability. Full-field optic flow patterns like expansion and rotation are elicited by distinct flight maneuvers such as body translation during straight flight or body rotation during hovering, respectively. Recent analyses suggest that under some experimental conditions the rotation optomotor response reflects the linear sum of different expansion response components. Are expansion and rotation-mediated visual stabilization responses part of a single optomotor response subserved by a neural circuit that is differentially stimulated by the two flow fields, or rather do the two behavioral responses reflect two distinct control systems? Guided by the principle that the properties of neural circuits are revealed in the behaviors they mediate, we systematically varied the spatial, temporal and contrast properties of expansion and rotation stimuli, and quantified the time course and amplitude of optomotor responses during tethered flight. Our results support the conclusion that expansion and rotation optomotor responses are indeed two separate reflexes, which draw from the same system of elementary motion detectors, but are likely mediated by separate pre-motor circuits having different spatial integration properties, low-pass characteristics and contrast sensitivity.},

Visual course control relies on estimating optic flow patterns which, in flies, are encoded by interneurons of the third optic ganglion. However, the rules that translate optic flow into flight motor commands remain poorly understood. Here, we measured the temporal dynamics of optomotor responses in tethered flies to optic flow fields about three cardinal axes. For each condition, we used white noise analysis to determine the optimal linear filters linking optic flow to the sum and difference of left and right wing beat amplitudes. The estimated filters indicate that flies react very quickly to perturbations of the motion field, with pure delays in the order of {\textasciitilde}20 ms and time-to-peak of {\textasciitilde}100 ms. By convolution the filters also predict responses to arbitrary stimulus sequences, accounting for over half the variance in 5 of our 6 stimulus types, demonstrating the approximate linearity of the system with respect to optic flow variables. In the remaining case of yaw optic flow we improved predictability by measuring individual flies, which also allowed us to analyze the variability of optomotor responses within a population. Finally, the linear filters at least partly explain the optomotor responses to superimposed and decomposed compound flow fields.},

Here, we focused on visual looming responsive {LC}6 cells in Drosophila, a population whose dendrites collectively cover the visual field, but whose axons form a single glomerulus—a structure without obvious retinotopic organization—in the central brain. We identified multiple cell types downstream of {LC}6 in the glomerulus and found that they more strongly respond to looming in different portions of the visual field, unexpectedly preserving spatial information. Through {EM} reconstruction of all {LC}6 synaptic inputs to the glomerulus, we found that {LC}6 and downstream cell types form circuits within the glomerulus that enable spatial readout of visual features and contralateral suppression—mechanisms that transform visual information for behavioral control.},

Although {TeTxLC} did not affect cycling of a clock-gene product at the gross level, it disrupted the rhythmic behavior of adult Drosophila. In constant darkness, the proportion of rhythmic flies was reduced in flies expressing active {TeTxLC} compared to controls, including those expressing inactive toxin. The behavior of {TeTxLC}-expressing flies was less synchronized to light:dark cycles than that of controls. To determine which neurons are responsible for these effects on behavior, the toxin was also expressed in restricted subsets of per/tim-expressing, laterally located pacemaker neurons by expressing {TeTxLC} under the control of a driver in which {GAL}4-encoding sequences are fused to the promoter of the pigment dispersing factor (pdf) gene. pdf-gal4-driven {TeTxLC} expression had relatively little effect on behavioral rhythms, implying that per/tim neurons other than pdf-expressing lateral neurons participate in the generation of rhythmic behavior. In another set of experiments, period gene products were expressed under the control of per-gal4 or tim-gal4. This resulted in an increased level of {PER} protein in many brain cells and reduction of bioluminescence cycling reported by a per-luciferase transgene, especially in the case of per expression affected by tim-gal4. This indicates a disruption of the transcriptional feedback loop that is a part of the oscillatory mechanism underlying Drosophila's circadian rhythms. Consistent with this molecular defect, the proportion of rhythmic individuals in constant darkness was subnormal in flies expressing {PER} under the control of tim-gal4, and their behavior in light:dark cycles was abnormal.},

The activation phenotypes of two {LC} types closely resemble natural avoidance behaviors triggered by a visual loom. In vivo two-photon calcium imaging reveals that these {LC} types respond to looming stimuli, while another type does not, but instead responds to the motion of a small object. Activation of {LC} neurons on only one side of the brain can result in attractive or aversive turning behaviors depending on the cell type.

Deletion of mouse Kir2.1 also causes cleft palate and digital defects. These defects are strikingly similar to phenotypes that result from disrupted {TGFβ}/{BMP} signaling. We use Drosophila melanogaster to show that a Kir2.1 homolog, Irk2, affects development by disrupting {BMP} signaling. Phenotypes of irk2 deficient lines, a mutant irk2 allele, irk2 {siRNA} and expression of a dominant-negative Irk2 subunit (Irk2DN) all demonstrate that Irk2 function is necessary for development of the adult wing. Compromised Irk2 function causes wing-patterning defects similar to those found when signaling through a Drosophila {BMP} homolog, Decapentaplegic (Dpp), is disrupted. To determine whether Irk2 plays a role in the Dpp pathway, we generated flies in which both Irk2 and Dpp functions are reduced. Irk2DN phenotypes are enhanced by decreased Dpp signaling. In wild-type flies, Dpp signaling can be detected in stripes along the anterior/posterior boundary of the larval imaginal wing disc. Reducing function of Irk2 with {siRNA}, an irk2 deletion, or expression of Irk2DN reduces the Dpp signal in the wing disc. As Irk channels contribute to Dpp signaling in flies, a similar role for Kir2.1 in {BMP} signaling may explain the morphological defects of Andersen-Tawil Syndrome and the Kir2.1 knockout mouse.},

	abstract = {Background: Flight is an integral component of many complex behavioral patterns in insects. The giant fiber circuit has been well studied in several insects including Drosophila. However, components of the insect flight circuit that respond to an air-puff stimulus and comprise the flight central pattern generator are poorly defined. Aminergic neurons have been implicated in locust, moth and Drosophila flight. Here we have investigated the requirement of neuronal activity in serotonergic neurons, during development and in adults, on air-puff induced flight in Drosophila.
Methodology/Principal Findings: To target serotonergic neurons specifically, a Drosophila strain that contains regulatory regions from the {TRH} (Tryptophan Hydroxylase) gene linked to the yeast transcription factor {GAL}4 was used. By blocking synaptic transmission from serotonergic neurons with a tetanus toxin transgene or by hyperpolarisation with Kir2.1, close to 50\% adults became flightless. Temporal expression of a temperature sensitive Dynamin mutant transgene (Shits) suggests that synaptic function in serotonergic neurons is required both during development and in adults. Depletion of {IP}3R in serotonergic neurons via {RNAi} did not affect flight. Interestingly, at all stages a partial requirement for synaptic activity in serotonergic neurons was observed. The status of serotonergic neurons was investigated in the central nervous system of larvae and adults expressing tetanus toxin. A small but significant reduction was observed in serotonergic cell number in adult second thoracic segments from flightless tetanus toxin expressing animals.
Conclusions: These studies show that loss of synaptic activity in serotonergic neurons causes a flight deficit. The temporal focus of the flight deficit is during pupal development and in adults. The cause of the flight deficit is likely to be loss of neurons and reduced synaptic function. Based on the partial phenotypes, serotonergic neurons appear to be modulatory, rather than an intrinsic part of the flight circuit.},

A new P-gal4 enhancer trap line is described that is mostly expressed in the {LNvs} This P-gal4 line was used to ablate the {LNvs} by using the pro-apoptosis gene bax, to stop {PER} protein oscillations by overexpressing per and to block synaptic transmission with the tetanus toxin light chain ({TeTxLC}). Genetic ablation of these clock cells leads to the loss of robust 24-h activity rhythms and reveals a phase advance in light-dark conditions as well as a weak short-period rhythm in constant darkness. This behavioural phenotype is similar to that described for disconnected1 (disco1) mutants, in which we show that the majority of the individuals have a reduced number of dorsally projecting lateral neurons which, however, fail to express {PER}. In both {LNv}-ablated and disco1 flies, {PER} cycles in the so-called dorsal neurons ({DNs}) of the superior protocerebrum, suggesting that the weak short-period rhythm could stem from these {PDF}-negative cells. The overexpression of per in {LNs} suppresses {PER} protein oscillations and leads to the disruption of both activity and eclosion rhythms, indicating that {PER} cycling in these cells is required for both of these rhythmic behaviours. Interestingly, flies overexpressing {PER} in the {LNs} do not show any weak short-period rhythms, although {PER} cycles in at least a fraction of the {DNs}, suggesting a dominant role of the {LNs} on the behavioural rhythms. Expression of {TeTxLC} in the {LNvs} does not impair activity rhythms, which indicates that the {PDF}-expressing neurons do not use synaptobrevin-dependent transmission to control these rhythms.},

	abstract = {We examine the role of synaptic activity in the development of identified Drosophila embryonic motorneurons. Synaptic activity was blocked by both pan-neuronal expression of tetanus toxin light chain ({TeTxLC}) and by reduction of acetylcholine ({ACh}) using a temperature-sensitive allele of choline acetyltransferase (Chats2). In the absence of synaptic activity, {aCC} and {RP}2 motorneurons develop with an apparently normal morphology and retain their capacity to form synapses. However, blockade of synaptic transmission results in significant changes in the electrical phenotype of these neurons. Specifically, increases are seen in both voltage-gated inward Na+ and voltage-gated outward K+ currents. Voltage-gated Ca2+currents do not change. The changes in conductances appear to promote neuron excitability. In the absence of synaptic activity, the number of action potentials fired by a depolarizing ramp (−60 to +60 {mV}) is increased and, in addition, the amplitude of the initial action potential fired is also significantly larger. Silencing synaptic input to just {aCC}, without affecting inputs to other neurons, demonstrates that the capability to respond to changing levels of synaptic excitation is intrinsic to these neurons. The alteration to electrical properties are not permanent, being reversed by restoration of normal synaptic function. Whereas our data suggest that synaptic activity makes little or no contribution to the initial formation of embryonic neural circuits, the electrical development of neurons that constitute these circuits seems to depend on a process that requires synaptic activity.},

	abstract = {This review, one of a series of articles, tries to make sense of optogenetics, a recently developed technology that can be used to control the activity of genetically-defined neurons with light. Cells are first genetically engineered to express a light-sensitive opsin, which is typically an ion channel, pump, or G protein–coupled receptor. When engineered cells are then illuminated with light of the correct frequency, opsin-bound retinal undergoes a conformational change that leads to channel opening or pump activation, cell depolarization or hyperpolarization, and neural activation or silencing. Since the advent of optogenetics, many different opsin variants have been discovered or engineered, and it is now possible to stimulate or inhibit neuronal activity or intracellular signaling pathways on fast or slow timescales with a variety of different wavelengths of light. Optogenetics has been successfully employed to enhance our understanding of the neural circuit dysfunction underlying mood disorders, addiction, and Parkinson’s disease, and has enabled us to achieve a better understanding of the neural circuits mediating normal behavior. It has revolutionized the field of neuroscience, and has enabled a new generation of experiments that probe the causal roles of specific neural circuit components.},

	abstract = {Animals use active sensing to respond to sensory inputs and guide future motor decisions. In flight, flies generate a pattern of head and body movements to stabilize gaze. How the brain relays visual information to control head and body movements and how active head movements influence downstream motor control remains elusive. Using a control theoretic framework, we studied the optomotor gaze stabilization reflex in tethered flight and quantified how head movements stabilize visual motion and shape wing steering efforts in fruit flies (Drosophila). By shaping visual inputs, head movements increased the gain of wing steering responses and coordination between stimulus and wings, pointing to a tight coupling between head and wing movements. Head movements followed the visual stimulus in as little as 10 ms—a delay similar to the human vestibulo-ocular reflex—whereas wing steering responses lagged by more than 40 ms. This timing difference suggests a temporal order in the flow of visual information such that the head filters visual information eliciting downstream wing steering responses. Head fixation significantly decreased the mechanical power generated by the flight motor by reducing wingbeat frequency and overall thrust. By simulating an elementary motion detector array, we show that head movements shift the effective visual input dynamic range onto the sensitivity optimum of the motion vision pathway. Taken together, our results reveal a transformative influence of active vision on flight motor responses in flies. Our work provides a framework for understanding how to coordinate moving sensors on a moving body.},

Indeed, recent studies found differences between responses of sensory neurons in resting versus moving insects. Since the dynamic range of visual motion stimuli strongly depends on the speed at which an animal is moving, we investigated whether the visual system adapts to such changes in stimulus dynamics as induced by self-motion. Lobula plate tangential cells of flies lend themselves well to study this question because they are known to code for ego-motion based on optic-flow. We recorded the responses of the lobula plate tangential cell H1 to a visual pattern moving at different velocities under three different conditions: fixed flies before and after application of the octopamine agonist chlordimeform ({CDM}) and tethered flying flies. {CDM} has been previously shown to induce arousal in flies. We found that flying as well as the application of {CDM} significantly broadens the velocity tuning of H1 toward higher velocities.},

	abstract = {The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster performs at least two distinct types of flight initiation. One kind is a stereotyped escape response to a visual stimulus that is mediated by the hard-wired giant fiber neural pathway, and the other is a more variable `voluntary' response that can be performed without giant fiber activation. Because the simpler escape take-offs are apparently successful, it is unclear why the fly has multiple pathways to coordinate flight initiation. In this study we use high-speed videography to observe flight initiation in unrestrained wild-type flies and assess the flight performance of each of the two types of take-off. Three-dimensional kinematic analysis of take-off sequences indicates that wing use during the jumping phase of flight initiation is essential for stabilizing flight. During voluntary take-offs, early wing elevation leads to a slower and more stable take-off. In contrast, during visually elicited escapes, the wings are pulled down close to the body during take-off, resulting in tumbling flights in which the fly translates faster but also rotates rapidly about all three of its body axes. Additionally, we find evidence that the power delivered by the legs is substantially greater during visually elicited escapes than during voluntary take-offs. Thus, we find that the two types of Drosophila flight initiation result in different flight performances once the fly is airborne,and that these performances are distinguished by a trade-off between speed and stability.},

	abstract = {The lobula giant motion detector ({LGMD}) is a wide-field bilateral visual interneuron in North American locusts that acts as an angular threshold detector during the approach of a solid square along a trajectory perpendicular to the long axis of the animal (Gabbiani et al., 1999a). We investigated the dependence of this angular threshold computation on several stimulus parameters that alter the spatial and temporal activation patterns of inputs onto the dendritic tree of the {LGMD}, across three locust species. The same angular threshold computation was implemented by {LGMD} in all three species. The angular threshold computation was invariant to changes in target shape (from solid squares to solid discs) and to changes in target texture (checkerboard and concentric patterns). Finally, the angular threshold computation did not depend on object approach angle, over at least 135° in the horizontal plane. A two-dimensional model of the responses of the {LGMD} based on linear summation of motion-related excitatory and size-dependent inhibitory inputs successfully reproduced the experimental results for squares and discs approaching perpendicular to the long axis of the animal. Linear summation, however, was unable to account for invariance to object texture or approach angle. These results indicate that {LGMD} is a reliable neuron with which to study the biophysical mechanisms underlying the generation of complex but invariant visual responses by dendritic integration. They also suggest that invariance arises in part from non-linear integration of excitatory inputs within the dendritic tree of the {LGMD}.},

	abstract = {In Drosophila, early visual processing of motion information segregates in separate {ON} and {OFF} pathways. These pathways have been studied in the context of local directional motion detection leading to the encoding of optic flow that provides visual information for flight stabilization. Less is known about their role in detecting impending collision and generating escape behaviors. ‘Looming’, the simulated approach of an object at constant speed towards an animal, provides a powerful stimulus eliciting jump escape behaviors in stationary flies. We presented looming stimuli mimicking the approach of either a dark object on a bright background or a light object on a dark background, while inactivating neurons belonging either to the {ON}- or the {OFF}-motion detection pathways by expressing the dominant Drosophila temperature-sensitive mutant shibirets in different cells of the {ON}/{OFF} pathway. Inactivation of {ON}, respectively {OFF}, neurons led to selective decreases in escape behavior to light, resp. dark, looming stimuli. Quantitative analysis showed a nearly perfect splitting of these effects according to the {ON}/{OFF} type of the targeted neural populations. Our results suggest that Drosophila {ON}/{OFF} motion detection pathways play an important role in controlling jump escape responses according to looming stimulus polarity. They further imply that the biophysical circuits triggering Drosophila jump escape behaviors likely differ substantially from those characterized in other arthropods.
Summary Inactivating fly neurons of the {ON} or {OFF} directional motion detection pathways during escape behavior selectively reduced jump responses to light and dark looming stimuli, respectively.},

	abstract = {Drosophila melanogaster exhibits a robust escape response to objects approaching on a collision course. Although a pair of large command interneurons called the giant fibers ({GFs}) have been postulated to trigger such behaviors, their role has not been directly demonstrated. Here, we show that escape from visual stimuli like those generated by approaching predators does not rely on the activation of the {GFs} and consists of a more complex and less stereotyped motor sequence than that evoked by the {GFs}. Instead, the timing of escape is tightly correlated with the activity of previously undescribed descending interneurons that signal a threshold angular size of the approaching object. The activity pattern of these interneurons shares features with those of visual escape circuits of several species, including pigeons, frogs, and locusts, and may therefore have evolved under similar constraints. These results show that visually evoked escapes in Drosophila can rely on at least two descending neuronal pathways: the {GFs} and the novel pathway we characterize electrophysiologically. These pathways exhibit very different patterns of sensory activity and are associated with two distinct motor programs.},

We found that multiple looming responsive {DNs} integrate looming information across both eyes, even though their dendrites are restricted to a single visual hemisphere. One {DN}, the giant fiber ({GF}), responds invariantly to looming stimuli across tested azimuthal locations. We confirmed visual information propagates to the {GF} from the contralateral eye, through an unidentified pathway, and demonstrated that the absence of this pathway alters {GF} responses to looming stimuli presented to the ipsilateral eye.

Analysis of {GAL}4 lines identified in an unbiased screen for increased female chasing behavior revealed the involvement of another sexually dimorphic neuron, {pC}1d, and implicated {aIPg} and {pC}1d neurons as core nodes regulating female aggression. Connectomic analysis demonstrated that {aIPg} neurons and {pC}1d are interconnected and suggest that {aIPg} neurons may exert part of their effect by gating the flow of visual information to descending neurons.

	abstract = {To navigate through the world, animals must stabilize their path against disturbances and change direction to avoid obstacles and to search for resources [1, 2]. Locomotion is thus guided by sensory cues but also depends on intrinsic processes, such as motivation and physiological state. Flies, for example, turn with the direction of large-ﬁeld rotatory motion, an optomotor reﬂex that is thought to help them ﬂy straight [3–5]. Occasionally, however, they execute fast turns, called body saccades, either spontaneously or in response to patterns of visual motion such as expansion [6–8]. These turns can be measured in tethered ﬂying Drosophila [3, 4, 9], which facilitates the study of underlying neural mechanisms. Whereas there is evidence for an efference copy input to visual interneurons during saccades [10], the circuits that control spontaneous and visually elicited saccades are not well known. Using two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings in tethered ﬂying Drosophila, we have identiﬁed a descending neuron whose activity is correlated with both spontaneous and visually elicited turns during tethered ﬂight. The cell’s activity in open- and closed-loop experiments suggests that it does not underlie slower compensatory responses to horizontal motion but rather controls rapid changes in ﬂight path. The activity of this neuron can explain some of the behavioral variability observed in response to visual motion and appears sufﬁcient for eliciting turns when artiﬁcially activated. This work provides an entry point into studying the circuits underlying the control of rapid steering maneuvers in the ﬂy brain.},

	abstract = {The clumped distribution of resources in the world has inﬂuenced the pattern of foraging behavior since the origins of locomotion, selecting for a common search motif in which straight movements through resourcepoor regions alternate with zig-zag exploration in resource-rich domains. For example, during local search, ﬂying ﬂies spontaneously execute rapid ﬂight turns, called body saccades, but suppress these maneuvers during long-distance dispersal or when surging upstream toward an attractive odor. Here, we describe the key cellular components of a neural network in ﬂies that generate spontaneous turns as well as a specialized pair of neurons that inhibits the network and suppresses turning. Using 2-photon imaging, optogenetic activation, and genetic ablation, we show that only four descending neurons appear sufﬁcient to generate the descending commands to execute ﬂight saccades. The network is organized into two functional units—one for right turns and one for left—with each unit consisting of an excitatory ({DNae}014) and an inhibitory ({DNb}01) neuron that project to the ﬂight motor neuropil within the ventral nerve cord. Using resources from recently published connectomes of the ﬂy, we identiﬁed a pair of large, distinct interneurons ({VES}041) that form inhibitory connections to all four saccade command neurons and created speciﬁc genetic driver lines for this cell. As predicted by its connectivity, activation of {VES}041 strongly suppresses saccades, suggesting that it promotes straight ﬂight to regulate the transition between local search and long-distance dispersal. These results thus identify the key elements of a network that may play a crucial role in foraging ecology.},

	abstract = {During their trajectories in still air, fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) explore their landscape using a series of straight flight paths punctuated by rapid 90° body-saccades [1]. Some saccades are triggered by visual expansion associated with collision avoidance. Yet many saccades are not triggered by visual cues, but rather appear spontaneously. Our analysis reveals that the control of these visually independent saccades and the flight intervals between them constitute an optimal scale-free active searching strategy. Two characteristics of mathematical optimality that are apparent during free-flight in Drosophila are inter-saccade interval lengths distributed according to an inverse square law, which does not vary across landscape scale, and 90° saccade angles, which increase the likelihood that territory will be revisited and thereby reduce the likelihood that near-by targets will be missed. We also show that searching is intermittent, such that active searching phases randomly alternate with relocation phases. Behaviorally, this intermittency is reflected in frequently occurring short, slow speed inter-saccade intervals randomly alternating with rarer, longer, faster inter-saccade intervals. Searching patterns that scale similarly across orders of magnitude of length (i.e., scale-free) have been revealed in animals as diverse as microzooplankton, bumblebees, albatrosses, and spider monkeys, but these do not appear to be optimised with respect to turning angle, whereas Drosophila free-flight search does. Also, intermittent searching patterns, such as those reported here for Drosophila, have been observed in foragers such as planktivorous fish and ground foraging birds. Our results with freely flying Drosophila may constitute the first reported example of searching behaviour that is both scale-free and intermittent.},

	abstract = {To study the visual cues that control steering behavior in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, we reconstructed three-dimensional trajectories from images taken by stereo infrared video cameras during free flight within structured visual landscapes. Flies move through their environment using a series of straight flight segments separated by rapid turns, termed saccades, during which the fly alters course by approximately 90° in less than 100 ms. Altering the amount of background visual contrast caused significant changes in the fly’s translational velocity and saccade frequency. Between saccades, asymmetries in the estimates of optic flow induce gradual turns away from the side experiencing a greater motion stimulus, a behavior opposite to that predicted by a flight control model based upon optomotor equilibrium. To determine which features of visual motion trigger saccades, we reconstructed the visual environment from the fly’s perspective for each position in the flight trajectory. From these reconstructions, we modeled the fly’s estimation of optic flow on the basis of a two-dimensional array of Hassenstein–Reichardt elementary motion detectors and, through spatial summation, the large-field motion stimuli experienced by the fly during the course of its flight. Event-triggered averages of the large-field motion preceding each saccade suggest that image expansion is the signal that triggers each saccade. The asymmetry in output of the local motion detector array prior to each saccade influences the direction (left versus right) but not the magnitude of the rapid turn. Once initiated, visual feedback does not appear to influence saccade kinematics further. The total expansion experienced before a saccade was similar for flight within both uniform and visually textured backgrounds. In summary, our data suggest that complex behavioral patterns seen during free flight emerge from interactions between the flight control system and the visual environment.},

The angular movements about the vertical body axis are characterized by a cascade of steplike changes of long axis orientation (‘turns’). Most of these turns are separated by periods of little or no rotation. Turns about the vertical axis are short (under 120 ms). They are performed at angular velocities of up to about 4000 deg s-1. These characteristics are found (i) when a single fly cruises in a stationary environment; (ii) if the visual input is eliminated; (iii) if a textured surround (optomotor stimulus) is moved around the fly; (iv) during visually guided pursuit of small targets in stationary as well as in moving environments. Optomotor stimulation increases the number of turns in the direction of pattern motion relative to those against it. This leads to a correlation between the average angular velocity of the fly and the stimulus velocity. However, optomotor stimulation does not interfere with chasing and tracking. A model is proposed that qualitatively accounts for the observed behaviour in free flight of houseflies.},

              Anyone who has tried to swat a fly knows that their powers of avoidance are impressive. Executing such rapid avoidance requires that the sensory recognition of an approaching threat be translated into evasive movement almost instantaneously.

            Avoiding predators is an essential behavior in which animals must quickly transform sensory cues into evasive actions. Sensory reflexes are particularly fast in flying insects such as flies, but the means by which they evade aerial predators is not known. Using high-speed videography and automated tracking of flies in combination with aerodynamic measurements on flapping robots, we show that flying flies react to looming stimuli with directed banked turns. The maneuver consists of a rapid body rotation followed immediately by an active counter-rotation and is enacted by remarkably subtle changes in wing motion. These evasive maneuvers of flies are substantially faster than steering maneuvers measured previously and indicate the existence of sensory-motor circuitry that can reorient the fly’s flight path within a few wingbeats.},

We analyzed the body saccades of fruit flies (Drosophila hydei), using high-speed 3D videography to track body and wing kinematics and a dynamically scaled robot to study the production of aerodynamic forces and moments. Although the size, degree and speed of the saccades vary, the dynamics of the maneuver are remarkably stereotypic. In executing a body saccade, flies perform a quick roll and counterroll, combined with a slower unidirectional rotation around their yaw axis. Flies regulate the size of the turn by adjusting the magnitude of torque that they produce about these control axes, while maintaining the orientation of the rotational axes in the body frame constant. In this way, body saccades are different from escape responses in the same species, in which the roll and pitch component of banking is varied to adjust turn angle. Our analysis of the wing kinematics and aerodynamics showed that flies control aerodynamic torques during the saccade primarily by adjusting the timing and amount of spanwise wing rotation.},

How rapid body saccades and smooth movement interact for simultaneous object pursuit and gaze stabilization is not understood. We directly observed these interactions in magnetically-tethered Drosophila free to rotate about the yaw axis. A moving bar elicited sustained bouts of saccades following the bar, with surprisingly little smooth movement. By contrast, a moving panorama elicited robust smooth movement interspersed with occasional optomotor saccades. The amplitude, angular velocity, and torque transients of bar-fixation saccades were finely tuned to the speed of bar motion, and were triggered by a threshold in the temporal integral of the bar error angle, rather than its absolute retinal position error. Optomotor saccades were tuned to the dynamics of panoramic image motion, and were triggered by a threshold in the integral of velocity over time. A hybrid control model based on integrated motion cues simulates saccade trigger and dynamics. We propose a novel algorithm for tuning fixation saccades in flies.},

In flight, Drosophila melanogaster classify equidistant large and small objects with categorically different behaviors: a tall object evokes approach whereas a small object elicits avoidance. We studied visuomotor behavior in rigidly and magnetically tethered D. melanogaster to reveal strategies that generate aversion to a small object. We discovered that small-object aversion in tethered flight is enabled by aversive saccades and smooth movement, which vary with the stimulus type. Aversive saccades in response to a short bar had different dynamics from approach saccades in response to a tall bar and the distribution of pre-saccade error angles was more stochastic for a short bar. Taken together, we show that aversive responses in D. melanogaster are driven in part by processes that elicit signed saccades with distinct dynamics and trigger mechanisms. Our work generates new hypotheses to study brain circuits that underlie classification of objects in D. melanogaster.},

              Neural processing in the brain controls behavior through descending neurons ({DNs}) - neurons which carry signals from the brain to the spinal cord (or thoracic ganglia in insects). Because {DNs} arise from multiple circuits in the brain, the numerical simplicity and availability of genetic tools make
              Drosophila
              a tractable model for understanding descending motor control. As a first step towards a comprehensive study of descending motor control, here we estimate the number and distribution of {DNs} in the
              Drosophila
              brain. We labeled {DNs} by backfilling them with dextran dye applied to the neck connective and estimated that there are {\textasciitilde}1100 {DNs} distributed in 6 clusters in
              Drosophila
              . To assess the distribution of {DNs} by neurotransmitters, we labeled {DNs} in flies in which neurons expressing the major neurotransmitters were also labeled. We found {DNs} belonging to every neurotransmitter class we tested: acetylcholine, {GABA}, glutamate, serotonin, dopamine and octopamine. Both the major excitatory neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) and the major inhibitory neurotransmitter ({GABA}) are employed equally; this stands in contrast to vertebrate {DNs} which are predominantly excitatory. By comparing the distribution of {DNs} in
              Drosophila
              to those reported previously in other insects, we conclude that the organization of {DNs} in insects is highly conserved.},

	abstract = {In a way analogous to human vision, the fruit fly D. melanogaster and many other flying insects generate smooth and saccadic movements to stabilize and shift their gaze in flight, respectively. It has been hypothesized that this combination of continuous and discrete movements benefits both flight stability and performance, particularly at high frequencies or speeds. Here we develop a hybrid control system model to explore the effects of saccades on the yaw stabilization reflex of D. melanogaster. Inspired from experimental data, the model includes a first order plant, a Proportional-Integral ({PI}) continuous controller, and a saccadic reset system that fires based on the integrated error of the continuous controller. We explore the gain, delay and switching threshold parameter space to quantify the optimum regions for yaw stability and performance. We show that the addition of saccades to a continuous controller provides benefits to both stability and performance across a range of frequencies. Our model suggests that Drosophila operates near its optimal switching threshold for its experimental gain set. We also show that based on experimental data, D. melanogaster operates in a region that trades off performance and stability. This trade-off increases flight robustness to compensate for internal perturbations such as wing damage.},

	abstract = {As animals move through the world in search of resources, they change course in reaction to both external sensory cues and internally-generated programs. Elucidating the functional logic of complex search algorithms is challenging because the observable actions of the animal cannot be unambiguously assigned to externally- or internally-triggered events. We present a technique that addresses this challenge by assessing quantitatively the contribution of external stimuli and internal processes. We apply this technique to the analysis of rapid turns (“saccades”) of freely flying Drosophila melanogaster. We show that a single scalar feature computed from the visual stimulus experienced by the animal is sufficient to explain a majority (93\%) of the turning decisions. We automatically estimate this scalar value from the observable trajectory, without any assumption regarding the sensory processing. A posteriori, we show that the estimated feature field is consistent with previous results measured in other experimental conditions. The remaining turning decisions, not explained by this feature of the visual input, may be attributed to a combination of deterministic processes based on unobservable internal states and purely stochastic behavior. We cannot distinguish these contributions using external observations alone, but we are able to provide a quantitative bound of their relative importance with respect to stimulus-triggered decisions. Our results suggest that comparatively few saccades in free-flying conditions are a result of an intrinsic spontaneous process, contrary to previous suggestions. We discuss how this technique could be generalized for use in other systems and employed as a tool for classifying effects into sensory, decision, and motor categories when used to analyze data from genetic behavioral screens.},

In insects, only a few descending neurons have been associated with specific behaviors. To explore how descending neurons control an insect’s movements, we developed a novel method to systematically assay the behavioral effects of activating individual neurons on freely behaving terrestrial D. melanogaster. We calculated a two-dimensional representation of the entire behavior space explored by these flies, and we associated descending neurons with specific behaviors by identifying regions of this space that were visited with increased frequency during optogenetic activation. Applying this approach across a large collection of descending neurons, we found that (1) activation of most of the descending neurons drove stereotyped behaviors, (2) in many cases multiple descending neurons activated similar behaviors, and (3) optogenetically activated behaviors were often dependent on the behavioral state prior to activation.},

              Drosophila
              —the {MDN} neurons. {MDN} activity is required for flies to walk backward when they encounter an impassable barrier and is sufficient to trigger backward walking under conditions in which flies would otherwise walk forward. We also identify ascending neurons, {MAN}, that promote persistent backward walking, possibly by inhibiting forward walking.

The reliability of recombinases such as Cre and {FLP} has allowed scientists to design complex strategies to study gene function in mammals. However, the retention of recombination sites in the genome limits the use of Cre and {FLP} recombinases in subsequent modifications. Access to additional recombinases in the {ES} cell toolbox would enormously widen the number of possibilities to manipulate the genome. In the method presented here, we combine the use of {PhiC}31, a site-specific integrase, with {FLP} to obtain site-specific insertion and replacement in pre-inserted docking sites in the genome of mouse {ES} cells. This method allows for the integration of any sequence of interest in a pre-defined locus, leaving Cre recombinase available for downstream applications. The selection strategy is based on a silent selection marker activated by a plasmid-delivered promoter, making the integration system highly reliable and reducing the need for extensive molecular screens. This article describes how to create “dockable” mouse embryonic stem ({ES}) cell lines, integrate incoming vectors, and analyze the resulting clones. Current applications of this technology are also discussed.},

Here, we examine visual and olfactory sensorimotor interactions in Drosophila. In a tethered-flight simulator, flies modulate wingbeat frequency and amplitude in response to visual and olfactory stimuli. Responses to both cues presented simultaneously are nearly identical to the sum of responses to stimuli presented in isolation for the onset and duration of odor delivery, suggesting independent sensorimotor pathways. Visual feedback does, however, alter the time course of the odor-off response. Based on the physiology of the flight motor system and recent free-flight analyses, we present a hypothetical model to account for the summation or superposition of sensorimotor responses during flight.},

	abstract = {Adult fruit flies follow attractive odors associated with food and oviposition sites through widely varied visual landscapes. To examine the interaction between olfactory and visual cues during search behavior, we recorded three-dimensional flight trajectories as individuals explored controlled sensory landscapes. When presented with the source of an attractive odor invisibly embedded in the floor of a 1 m arena, flies spend most of their time hovering back and forth over the source when flying within a randomly textured visual background but fail to localize the source when searching within a uniform white surround. To test whether flies are associating unique features of the visual background with the strength of odor cues, we flew them within arenas containing evenly spaced vertical stripes. Flies readily localized the odor when flying within visual landscapes lacking azimuthal landmarks provided that vertical edges were present. Flies failed to localize odor when flying within a background pattern consisting of horizontal stripes. These results suggest that, whereas flies do not require spatially unique visual patterns to localize an odor source, they do require visual feedback generated by vertical edges. Quantitative shifts in several components of flight behavior accompanied successful odor localization. Flies decrease flight altitude, turn more often and approach visually textured walls of the arena near an odor source. A simple model based on the statistics of flight behavior supports the hypothesis that a subtle influence on these behaviors is sufficient to lead a fly to its food.},

Induction of heat shock was measured in a variety of cell types, including neurons and somatic muscles, by the expression of β-galactosidase from an hsp26-{lacZ} reporter construct or by expression of a {UAS} target gene after induction of {hsGAL}4. We discuss the applicability of this technique to ectopic gene expression studies, lineage tracing, gene inactivation studies, and studies of cells in vitro.

            The ability to reproducibly target expression of transgenes to small, defined subsets of cells is a key experimental tool for understanding many biological processes. The Drosophila nervous system contains thousands of distinct cell types and it has generally not been possible to limit expression to one or a few cell types when using a single segment of genomic {DNA} as an enhancer to drive expression. Intersectional methods, in which expression of the transgene only occurs where two different enhancers overlap in their expression patterns, can be used to achieve the desired specificity. This report describes a set of over 2800 transgenic lines for use with the split-{GAL}4 intersectional method.},

Until recently, transgene expression could be targeted in the dimension of either time or space, but not both. Several new systems have recently been developed to direct transgene expression simultaneously in both time and space. We describe here two such systems that we developed in our laboratory. The first system provides a general method for temporal and regional gene expression targeting ({TARGET}) with the conventional {GAL}4-upstream activator sequence ({UAS}) system and a temperature-sensitive {GAL}80 molecule, which represses {GAL}4 transcriptional activity at permissive temperatures. The second system, termed Gene-Switch, is based on a {GAL}4-progesterone receptor chimera that is hormone-inducible. We have used both systems for simultaneous spatial and temporal rescue of memory dysfunction in the rutabaga (rut) memory mutant of Drosophila. In this protocol, we provide guidelines for the use of these two novel systems, which should have general utility in studying Drosophila biology and in using the fly as a model for human disease.},

The gene encoding the yeast transcriptional activator {GAL}4 is inserted randomly into the Drosophila genome to drive {GAL}4 expression from one of a diverse array of genomic enhancers. It is then possible to introduce a gene containing {GAL}4 binding sites within its promoter, to activate it in those cells where {GAL}4 is expressed, and to observe the effect of this directed misexpression on development. We have used {GAL}4-directed transcription to expand the domain of embryonic expression of the homeobox protein even-skipped. We show that even-skipped represses wingless and transforms cells that would normally secrete naked cuticle into denticle secreting cells. The {GAL}4 system can thus be used to study regulatory interactions during embryonic development. In adults, targeted expression can be used to generate dominant phenotypes for use in genetic screens. We have directed expression of an activated form of the Dras2 protein, resulting in dominant eye and wing defects that can be used in screens to identify other members of the Dras2 signal transduction pathway.},

	abstract = {Sleep is an important physiological state, but its function and regulation remain elusive. In Drosophila melanogaster, a useful model organism for studying sleep, forward genetic screens have identified important sleep-modulating genes and pathways; however, the results of such screens may be limited by developmental abnormalities or lethality associated with mutation of certain genes. To circumvent these limitations, we used a small-molecule screen to identify sleep-modulating genes and pathways. We administered 1280 pharmacologically active small molecules to adult flies and monitored their sleep. We found that administration of reserpine, a small-molecule inhibitor of the vesicular monoamine transporter ({VMAT}) that repackages monoamines into presynaptic vesicles, resulted in an increase in sleep. Supporting the idea that {VMAT} is the sleep-relevant target of reserpine, we found that {VMAT}-null mutants have an increased sleep phenotype, as well as an increased arousal threshold and resistance to the effects of reserpine. However, although the {VMAT} mutants are consistently resistant to reserpine, other aspects of their sleep phenotype are dependent on genetic background. These findings indicate that small-molecule screens can be used effectively to identify sleep-modulating genes whose phenotypes may be suppressed in traditional genetic screens. Mutations affecting single monoamine pathways did not affect reserpine sensitivity, suggesting that effects of {VMAT}/reserpine on sleep are mediated by multiple monoamines. Overall, we identify {VMAT} as an important regulator of sleep in Drosophila and demonstrate that small-molecule screens provide an effective approach to identify genes and pathways that impact adult Drosophila behavior.},

Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The diversity and dense interconnectivity of cells in the nervous system present a huge challenge to understanding how brains work. Recent progress toward such understanding, however, has been fuelled by the development of techniques for selectively monitoring and manipulating the function of distinct cell types—and even individual neurons—in the brains of living animals. These sophisticated techniques are fundamentally genetic and have found their greatest application in genetic model organisms, such as the fruit fly {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Drosophila melanogaster{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}. {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Drosophila{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} combines genetic tractability with a compact, but cell-type rich, nervous system and has been the incubator for a variety of methods of neuronal targeting. One such method, called Split Gal4, is playing an increasingly important role in mapping neural circuits in the fly. In conjunction with functional perturbations and behavioral screens, Split Gal4 has been used to characterize circuits governing such activities as grooming, aggression, and mating. It has also been leveraged to comprehensively map and functionally characterize cells composing important brain regions, such as the central complex, lateral horn, and the mushroom body—the latter being the insect seat of learning and memory. With connectomics data emerging for both the larval and adult brains of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Drosophila{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, Split Gal4 is also poised to play an important role in characterizing neurons of interest based on their connectivity. We summarize the history and current state of the Split Gal4 method and indicate promising areas for further development or future application.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

With more tissue types and observable behaviors than in other short-generation model organisms, and with vast genome data available for many species within the genus, the ﬂy’s tractable complexity will continue to enable exciting opportunities to explore mechanisms of complex developmental programs, behaviors, and broader evolutionary questions.

	abstract = {Johnston’s organ is the largest mechanosensory organ in Drosophila. It contributes to hearing, touch, vestibular sensing, proprioception, and wind sensing. In this study, we used in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging and unsupervised image segmentation to map the tuning properties of Johnston’s organ neurons ({JONs}) at the site where their axons enter the brain. We then applied the same methodology to study two key brain regions that process signals from {JONs}: the antennal mechanosensory and motor center ({AMMC}) and the wedge, which is downstream of the {AMMC}. First, we identified a diversity of {JON} response types that tile frequency space and form a rough tonotopic map. Some {JON} response types are direction selective; others are specialized to encode amplitude modulations over a specific range (dynamic range fractionation). Next, we discovered that both the {AMMC} and the wedge contain a tonotopic map, with a significant increase in tonotopy—and a narrowing of frequency tuning—at the level of the wedge. Whereas the {AMMC} tonotopic map is unilateral, the wedge tonotopic map is bilateral. Finally, we identified a subregion of the {AMMC}/wedge that responds preferentially to the coherent rotation of the two mechanical organs in the same angular direction, indicative of oriented steady air flow (directional wind). Together, these maps reveal the broad organization of the primary and secondary mechanosensory regions of the brain. They provide a framework for future efforts to identify the specific cell types and mechanisms that underlie the hierarchical re-mapping of mechanosensory information in this system.},

	abstract = {To convert intentions into actions, movement instructions must pass from the brain to downstream motor circuits through descending neurons ({DNs}). These include small sets of command-like neurons that are sufficient to drive behaviours1—the circuit mechanisms for which remain unclear. Here we show that command-like {DNs} in Drosophila directly recruit networks of additional {DNs} to orchestrate behaviours that require the active control of numerous body parts. Specifically, we found that command-like {DNs} previously thought to drive behaviours alone2–4 in fact co-activate larger populations of {DNs}. Connectome analyses and experimental manipulations revealed that this functional recruitment can be explained by direct excitatory connections between command-like {DNs} and networks of interconnected {DNs} in the brain. Descending population recruitment is necessary for behavioural control: {DNs} with many downstream descending partners require network co-activation to drive complete behaviours and drive only simple stereotyped movements in their absence. These {DN} networks reside within behaviour-specific clusters that inhibit one another. These results support a mechanism for command-like descending control in which behaviours are generated through the recruitment of increasingly large {DN} networks that compose behaviours by combining multiple motor subroutines.},

Until recently, research on the Drosophila brain was hindered by the lack of a complete and uniform nomenclature. Recognizing this,  produced an authoritative nomenclature for the adult insect brain, using Drosophila as the reference. Here, we extend this nomenclature to the adult thoracic and abdominal neuromeres, the ventral nerve cord ({VNC}), to provide an anatomical description of this major component of the Drosophila nervous system. The {VNC} is the locus for the reception and integration of sensory information and involved in generating most of the locomotor actions that underlie fly behaviors. The aim is to create a nomenclature, definitions, and spatial boundaries for the Drosophila {VNC} that are consistent with other insects. The work establishes an anatomical framework that provides a powerful tool for analyzing the functional organization of the {VNC}.},

We used single-cell transcriptomics to generate an unbiased classification of cellular diversity in the {VNC} of five-day old adult flies. We produced an atlas of 26,000 high-quality cells, representing more than 100 transcriptionally distinct cell types. The predominant gene signatures defining neuronal cell types reflect shared developmental histories based on the neuroblast from which cells were derived, as well as their birth order. The relative position of cells along the anterior-posterior axis could also be assigned using adult Hox gene expression. This single-cell transcriptional atlas of the adult fly {VNC} will be a valuable resource for future studies of neurodevelopment and behavior.},
